// implementation



first all the time odd
second all the time

cnt the number of first one and the second one

then count the number that are in ? here

keep on checking the number of goals of one team is less(let's say)

than the second one by adding with the remaining chance

let's say if both the team are scoring same at every kick 

i.e either they are scoring 0 or 1 continue

if any team scored greater than the other team then 

suppose its all future kicks will not score

and the losing team future kicks will score

and then if wining team is still wining then return that index

else continue


we'll intialise team1 , doubt1 , team2 , doubt2 

how we'll calculate the remaining kicks of any team

we subtract the index from 10 and divide it by 2 

if we are at odd index then add 1 for team 2 if it is victim 


we'll check at each iteration if

wining team score > losing team score + its doubts + remaining 

if at any index it satisfy we return that index else return 10
